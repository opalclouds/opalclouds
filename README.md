# Hi, I’m Shreya 👋

I build models for the real world : fraud, credit risk, ESG forecasting, and anything that demands clarity.  
I’m a chemical engineer who moved into fintech AI, and now I’m exploring deeper research directions in LLMs, RAG systems, and applied machine intelligence.

### 🌿 What I’m doing now
Building LLM + RAG pipelines for loan and credit analysis using unstructured financial documents.  
Working on systems that can read, reason, and deliver decisions that actually matter.

### 🌷 Projects I’ve built
- **LLM Fraud Triage System (ICICI)** : 45% faster investigations  
- **Credit Risk RAG + XGBoost** : 0.84 AUC  
- **ESG-driven KPI Forecasting (IIM Mumbai)** : R² up to 0.71  
- **Emotion Recognition from Speech** : 0.89 accuracy  
- **Sketch Recognition CNN** : ~90% accuracy

### 🌼 What I’m looking for
Research opportunities in AI/ML especially LLM reasoning, retrieval systems, hybrid modeling, and interpretable machine learning.
